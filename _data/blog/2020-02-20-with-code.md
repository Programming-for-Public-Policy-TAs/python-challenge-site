# Divvy Bike Demand Analysis

**Instructions**: clone the repository below to your computer and complete the problems in both python files. To submit your solutions, click the "Submit Solutions" button on the home page and fill out the form with your name and a link to the repository with your solutions. Make sure the repository you submit is set to "public" so we can see it. Submit before the deadline for credit on our Python Superstars leaderboard! 

Divvy is Chicago's bike share system, which consists of almost 600 stations scattered around the city with blue bikes available for anyone to rent. Users begin a ride by removing a bike from a dock, and then they can end their ride by returning the bike to a dock at any Divvy station in the city. You are going to use real data from Divvy collected at 1:30pm on 4/7/2020 to analyze supply and demand for bikes in the system.

```python
import json

# do not delete; this is the data you'll be working with
divvy_stations = json.loads(open('divvy_stations.txt').read())

# PROBLEM 1
# find average number of empty docks (num_docks_available) and 
# available bikes (num_bikes_available) at all stations in the system


# PROBLEM 2
# find ratio of bikes that are currently rented to total bikes in the system (ignore ebikes)


# PROBLEM 3 
# Add a new variable for each divvy station's entry, "percent_bikes_remaining", that shows 
# the percentage of bikes available at each individual station (again ignore ebikes). 
# This variable should be formatted as a percentage rounded to 2 decimal places, e.g. 66.67%
```
