# Your Challenge

This challenge is very simple and kind of like a mini final project. You'll only need material up to Lecture 15. Your task is simply to find a dataset and make some visualizations that reveal something interesting about the data.

### Instructions:

1) Scrape data from the web:

Use Pandas Datareader or a requests.get for a direct link to a file (no beautiful soup stuff or post requests)

2a) If the data is messy, clean it.

2b) If the data is already clean merge at least one additional dataset

3) Make 2-4 graphs or charts to show us something interesting about the data

4) Submit a link to your public Github repo containing your python file via the form on this website

Graphs and charts should have a title, clearly labeled axes and a legend/annotation where it would be needed for clarity
