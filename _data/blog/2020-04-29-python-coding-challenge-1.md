# Schelling Agent-based Model

Thomas Schelling (1971) created an agent based model using checker boards to simulate the creation of segregated neighborhoods, in a society where no individual necessarily has a strong preference for segregation. To see a simulation with a visual component, visit the bottom of this page: <http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/>



### Your Task:

The following code will replicate his model in Python. We will not create a visual component in this class, though it is well within Python's abilities to do so. We will use the following guidelines:

1. At least two kinds of agents
2. Each agent needs a preference for similar neighbors
3. Each agent gets to move around if preference not met



### Expectations[](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/IPPP%20ABM%20Lecture%201.ipynb#Expectations)

The code may look daunting, especially in the later steps, but you should have all of the tools necessary to read and understand this code. Very few new concepts are introduced, and the ones that are are simple. Your homework assignment (pending) will involve understanding the final stage of our model well enough to modify it slightly.





**How to begin**: clone the repository below to your computer and complete the problems in both python files. To submit your solutions, click the "Submit Solutions" button on the home page and fill out the form with your name and a link to the repository with your solutions. Make sure the repository you submit is set to "public" so we can see it. Submit before the deadline for credit on our Python Superstars leaderboard!
