### Part 1:

```python
'''
Optional Activity:
task: use a list to create a string or a few strings
If you don't have an idea: 
Alter the example below so that instead of 4 sentences, you only print 2:
print "I've lived in CA, NM, and MO. Now I live in IL" 
'''

#note this is how str.format() works:
my_string = "Stuff {} and more stuff {}. Other stuff {}"
#my_string.format(what goes in the first{}, on the second{}, third{}, etc)
my_string.format('that I say', 'that I want to say', 'that should not be said')

#e.g.
states = ['CA', 'NM', 'MO', 'IL']
current = 'IL'

for state in states: #we will cover for loops later
    if state is current: 
        print("Now I live in "+ state)
    else:
        print("I've lived in "+ state)

#or do the same thing a little differently
states = ['CA', 'NM', 'MO', 'IL']
current = 'IL'

for state in states:
    if state is current:
        print("Now I live in {}".format(state))
    else:
        print("I've lived in {}".format(state))

#also the same!
for i in range(len(states)):
    if states[i] is current: 
        print("Now I live in "+ states[i])
    else:
        print("I've lived in "+ states[i])
```

### Part 2:

```python
initial_list = ['1', 2.4, 1, 'Hello World!', 2, 5, 400, 5.6890,
                 3.1415, 'It is fine', 4, 20, 49, 51.3]

#output: a dictionary of lists
#each value should be a list containing only one data type,
#if the data type is integer, sort odds and evens into different lists

#A Solution:

string_list = []
even_int_list = []
odd_int_list = []
float_list = []

for x in initial_list:
    if isinstance(x, str):
        string_list.append(x)
    elif isinstance(x, int):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            even_int_list.append(x)
        else:
            odd_int_list.append(x)
    elif isinstance(x, float):
        float_list.append(x)

my_dict = {'strings': string_list, 'evens': even_int_list, 
            'odds': odd_int_list, 'floats': float_list}


#w/o a for loop:
if isinstance(initial_list[0], str):
        string_list.append(initial_list[0])
#etc
#and repeat
```
